Note:
* Whenever we want to generate the JWT token the user has to be authenticated first with the login Api or
by returning the token on an endpoint that requires authentication on the headers like /user on section11
* /login api is permitAll() to allow access
* The custom filter class that validates the token (JWTTokenValidatorFilter) will skip the validation on the /user endpoint


Steps to use JWT tokens in Spring Security
1. Add dependencies
2. Make the application Stateless to not use sessions. SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS
2.1 the token will not be stored in the session. once the clients send it to the server, it will be validated
3. Allow the server to send Headers on the response.
4. Create a custom filter (JWTTokenGeneratorFilter) to intercept the request and validate the token (OncePerRequestFilter)
5. To skip the token creation on every request use shouldNotFilter() method to only apply the filter on the login endpoint
6. Create JWTTokenValidatorFilter to validate the token and authenticate the user
7. Add the filter to the chain of filters on the security configuration
8. Generate the token at JWTTokenGeneratorFilter.doFilterInternal() , dont forget to continue the filter chain
9. Validate the token at JWTTokenValidatorFilter.doFilterInternal()
10. Test the JWT generation and validation at /user  and /account endpoints of section 11
10.1 To validate just send a BasicAuthentication with username and password
10.2 check token payload at https://jwt.io/ if it matches the business logic
11. Create a custom authentication provider to receive the user auth details and authenticate the user manually

Opaque tokens:
Are typically random strings with no inherit meaning.
Used to reference authentication information stored on the server-side.
Requires a call to the server to validate the token and obtain the user details.
Useful for scenarios where token validation by a central server is feasible such as within a secure internal network.

JWT tokens:
Are self-contained data tokens than consist of three parts:
Header, Payload, and Signature, encoded in Base64.
Can be validated locally by verifying the signature using a public key, without needing a server call.


Cors configurations:
since the UI application and the backend application,
they are deployed at a different domain location
at different origin location,
we have made these cors related configurations (on the config files)
