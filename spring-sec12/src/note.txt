 - This project is to add security to the project at a method level
 - This method protection can be on any class: controller, service, repository
 - In general, method level security allow to have an additional layer of security on methods
that returns sensitive data

Enforcing the security with the help of method level security is going to be super helpful
so that the business logic or the methods can be invoke by authenticated and authorized users only.

Approaches on how we are going to apply the authorization rules:
1. Invocation authorization: validate whether the user can invoke a method or not based on their
roles/authorities
2. Filtering authorization: Validates what a method can receive through its parameters and what the
                            invoker can receive back from the method post business logic execution.

Steps:
1. Enable @EnableMethodSecurity on SpringSec12Application.java
2. Add @EnableMethodSecurity(jsr250Enabled = true, securedEnabled = true) this allow other annotations like
@RolesAllowed, @PermitAll, @DenyAll and @Secured
3.
