# Authentication and Authorization

1. User logs-in with their credentials
2. Once login is successful, the user is given a Role or Authority which has permission
to make certain request inside the Spring Boot web application

# Create table customer with roles and authorities
Authorities define an individual privilege or action, it restricts access in a fine-grained manner
E.g: VIEW_ACCOUNT, VIEW_CARDS

Roles is a group of privileges/actions, it restricts access in a coarse-grained manner(access is restricted in a broad and general way,
without much detail or specificity.)
* Write it on the DB with the prefix ROLE_
* On the Spring app only user the name of the role: USER, ADMIN
E.g: ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN

Authentication: Identity of the user is verified for providing access to the system
Authorization: authorities are checked for accessing the resources, Authorities + Roles

Error codes:
Authentication: 401
Authorization: 403 is forbidden also

You have to define Roles and Authorities over the actions the user can perform in the system
